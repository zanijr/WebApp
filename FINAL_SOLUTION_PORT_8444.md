# 🚨 Final Solution: Port 8444 Issue

## Problem Identified
Port 8444 is **NOT supported** by Cloudflare's proxy service. This is why you're getting connection timeouts even though your server is configured correctly.

## ✅ Server Status: WORKING
Your server is correctly configured and running:
- ✅ SSL certificates created and mounted
- ✅ nginx listening on port 8444 with HTTPS
- ✅ Docker containers running properly
- ✅ Local tests on server show HTTP 200 and HTTPS 200

## 🔧 Solutions

### Solution 1: Disable Cloudflare Proxy (Recommended for port 8444)
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select `bananas4life.com` domain
3. Go to **DNS** settings
4. Find the `family` record
5. Click the **🟠 orange cloud** to make it **⚫ gray** (DNS only)
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for DNS propagation
7. Test: `https://family.bananas4life.com:8444`

### Solution 2: Use Standard Ports (Best Overall Solution)
1. Keep Cloudflare proxy **🟠 enabled** (orange cloud)
2. Access your app at: `https://family.bananas4life.com` (no port needed)
3. Cloudflare will handle SSL termination and forward to your server

### Solution 3: Use a Cloudflare-Supported Port
If you must use a custom port with Cloudflare proxy, use one of these:
- **HTTPS**: 443, 2053, 2083, 2087, 2096, 8443
- **HTTP**: 80, 8080, 8880, 2052, 2082, 2086, 2095

## 🎯 Recommended Action
**Use Solution 1** (disable Cloudflare proxy) if you specifically need port 8444:

```bash
# After disabling Cloudflare proxy, test with:
curl -k -I https://family.bananas4life.com:8444/
```

## 📊 Current Status
```
✅ Server: Fully configured and working
✅ SSL: Certificates created and working
✅ nginx: Listening on port 8444 with HTTPS
✅ Docker: All containers running
❌ Cloudflare: Blocking port 8444 (proxy enabled)
```

## Why This Happens
Cloudflare only allows specific ports through their proxy service for security reasons. Port 8444 is not in their allowed list, so connections are blocked at the Cloudflare edge.

Your server configuration is perfect - the issue is purely a Cloudflare proxy limitation.
